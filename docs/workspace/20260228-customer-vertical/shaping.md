## Requirements (R)

> Chunked to 9 top-level requirements (R0–R8). Sub-requirements carry the detail.
> Must-have = P0 from spec. Should-have = P1. Nice-to-have = P2.

| ID    | Requirement                                                                               | Status       |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **R0** | **Core goal: wire the mock customer vertical to Supabase with full CRUD, becoming the real-entity foundation all other verticals link against** | Core goal |

## Scope Decision: Communication Integrations

**Question**: Email auto-filing, SMS (Twilio), voicemail transcription — in or out?

**Decision**: **Out of scope.** Each is as large as a micro-vertical:
- Email auto-filing: requires email provider selection (Resend/Postmark/mailbox parsing), webhook handling, threading logic
- SMS (Twilio): phone number provisioning, webhook setup, opt-in compliance
- Voicemail transcription: telephony provider, audio storage, transcription API

**Schema is in scope.** `customer_activities.source` enum already includes `email | sms | voicemail`. When these integrations are built, each becomes one more writer to the same table. The timeline UI renders them automatically from `source` + `direction`.

## Shapes

### A: Horizontal Layers (DB → Repos → Actions → UI in sequence)

| Part | Mechanism |
| ---- | --------- |
| A1 | Wave 0: All ~8 tables in one migration (customers, contacts, addresses, groups, activities, tax_exemptions, group_members, referrals) |
| A2 | Wave 1: All Supabase repository reads |
| A3 | Wave 2: All server actions for all mutations |
| A4 | Wave 3: Wire customer list + all detail tabs simultaneously |
| A5 | Wave 4: Cross-vertical wiring |

### B: Core-Out Vertical Slices (one sub-entity at a time)

| Part | Mechanism |
| ---- | --------- |
| B1 | Wave 0: customers + contacts + addresses schema + repo + basic CRUD → working list + detail |
| B2 | Wave 1: Activity timeline (schema + service + auto-logging) |
| B3 | Wave 2: Financial layer (tax, credit, balance, per-state) |
| B4 | Wave 3: Intelligence (lifecycle rules, health, seasonal, preferences fix) |
| B5 | Wave 4: Cross-vertical (quotes, jobs, invoices FK + address snapshot) |
| B6 | Wave 5: dbt models |

### C: Core Platform + Parallel Extension Waves

| Part | Mechanism |
| ---- | --------- |
| **C1** | **Wave 0: Full schema** — All tables in one migration (R1.1–R1.7). One PR. Schema is the critical path dependency for all parallel waves. |
| **C2** | **Wave 1a: Core CRUD** — Supabase repo provider, customer + contact + address server actions, list + detail wired (R2, R3, R4 basics) |
| **C3** | **Wave 1b: Activity Timeline** — Service layer, manual notes, auto-logging service; starts immediately after Wave 0 (parallel with C2) |
| **C4** | **Wave 2a: Financial Management** — Credit limits, balance computation, tax exemption (basic + per-state), financial tab wired (R5) |
| **C5** | **Wave 2b: Intelligence Layer** — Lifecycle rules service, health score service, seasonal detection via dbt, favorites cascade fix (R7) |
| **C6** | **Wave 3: Cross-Vertical Wiring** — Quote/job/invoice FK, address snapshot, customer combobox reads Supabase, auto-logging hooks into W1b service (R8) |
| **C7** | **Wave 4: dbt Models** — dim_customers, fct_customer_orders, customer_seasonality_mart; can run anytime after Wave 0 (parallel) |

## Fit Check

| Req | Requirement | Status | A | B | C |
| --- | ----------- | ------ | - | - | - |
| R0 | Core goal: wire mock vertical to Supabase, foundation for all verticals | Core goal | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R1 | Data Foundation — Drizzle schema + migrations | Must-have | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R2 | Infrastructure Layer — repo + server actions | Must-have | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R3 | Customer List — search, filter, sort, pagination | Must-have | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R4 | Customer Detail — all tabs wired | Must-have | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R5 | Financial Management | Mixed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R6 | Activity Timeline | Must-have | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R7 | Intelligence Layer | Mixed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R8 | Cross-Vertical Wiring + Portal Foundation | Must-have | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| — | Delivers working end-to-end value early in sprint | Constraint | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| — | Waves can run in parallel (AI team, max subscription) | Constraint | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| — | Schema designed once, stable foundation for all parallel work | Constraint | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| — | PR risk: no single monster PR that touches everything | Constraint | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Notes:**

- A fails early-value constraint: nothing is visible until Wave 3 completes all four prior waves. Long before Gary can test anything.
- A fails parallelism: strict sequential layers block concurrent agent execution.
- B fails parallelism: each wave blocks the next. The schema in Wave 0 is repeated per slice — risk of migration drift.
- B fails stable schema: each slice adds to the schema incrementally, creating dependencies between slices in the same wave.
- C passes all: Wave 0 (schema) is done once, then 1a/1b run in parallel, then 2a/2b run in parallel.

---

## Selected Shape: C — Core Platform + Parallel Extension Waves

**Rationale**: The critical insight for a one-week sprint with parallel AI execution is that **schema is the only true critical path dependency**. Once Wave 0 ships (all tables, one migration), every other wave is blocked only by Wave 0 — not by each other. Waves 1a and 1b can run simultaneously on different agents. Waves 2a and 2b similarly. The dbt wave (C7) can even run concurrently with any post-Wave-0 work. This makes the parallelization model explicit and maximizes throughput.

---

## Activity Timeline Mechanism

The most uncertain mechanism in the shape. Four options considered:

### C3 Options: Activity Auto-Logging Mechanism

| Req | Requirement | Status | C3-A Repo Side Effects | C3-B Server Action Orchestration | C3-C DB Triggers | C3-D Event Bus |
| --- | ----------- | ------ | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| R6.3 | Auto-log from quote server actions | Must-have | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R6.4 | Auto-log from job server actions | Must-have | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R6.5 | Auto-log from invoice server actions | Must-have | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| — | Logic lives in TypeScript (testable) | Constraint | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| — | No cross-domain coupling at repository layer | Constraint | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| — | No new infrastructure required | Constraint | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| — | Aligns with existing server action pattern | Constraint | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

**Notes:**
- C3-A (repo side effects) fails cross-domain isolation: QuoteRepository calling CustomerActivityService couples two domain repositories.
- C3-C (DB triggers) fails TypeScript testability: logic lives in SQL functions, hard to unit test, invisible in application code.
- C3-D (event bus) fails no-new-infrastructure: requires a global emitter or pub/sub infrastructure not present in the codebase.
- C3-B passes all: each server action (quote, job, invoice) calls `customerActivityService.log()` after its primary operation. The service is a shared domain service in `src/domain/services/customer-activity.service.ts`. Testable, no new infrastructure, no cross-repo coupling.

**Selected: C3-B — Server Action Orchestration**

```
Server Action (quote create)
  ├── quoteRepo.create(...)
  └── customerActivityService.log({ customerId, source: 'system', content: 'Quote Q-101 created', relatedEntityType: 'quote', relatedEntityId })
```

## Shape C: Parts Table (Detail)

| Part | Mechanism | Flag |
| ---- | --------- | :--: |
| **C1** | **Wave 0: Full Schema (one migration)** | |
| C1.1 | `customers` table: id, shop_id, company, lifecycle_stage, health_status, type_tags[], payment_terms, pricing_tier, discount_pct, tax_exempt, tax_exempt_cert_expiry, credit_limit, referral_by_customer_id, metadata JSONB, is_archived, created_at, updated_at | |
| C1.2 | `contacts` table: id, customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, title, role[] enum (ordering/billing/art-approver), is_primary, portal_access, can_approve_proofs, can_place_orders, created_at | |
| C1.3 | `addresses` table: id, customer_id, label, type (billing/shipping/both), street1, street2, city, state, zip, country, attention_to, is_primary_billing, is_primary_shipping, created_at | |
| C1.4 | `customer_groups` + `customer_group_members` tables | |
| C1.5 | `customer_activities` table: id, customer_id, shop_id, source enum, direction enum, actor_type (staff/system/customer), actor_id, content, external_ref, related_entity_type, related_entity_id, created_at | |
| C1.6 | `customer_tax_exemptions` table: id, customer_id, state (2-char), cert_number, document_url, expiry_date, verified, created_at | |
| C1.7 | Indexes: `customers(shop_id, company)` for list, `contacts(customer_id)`, `customer_activities(customer_id, created_at DESC)`, `customer_tax_exemptions(customer_id, state)` | |
| C1.8 | RLS policies: all tables scoped to `shop_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'shop_id'`; seed data: 5 realistic 4Ink-style customers | |
| **C2** | **Wave 1a: Core CRUD** | |
| C2.1 | `SupabaseCustomerRepository` class implementing `ICustomerRepository` port. Registered in `src/infrastructure/bootstrap.ts`. Returns Zod-validated domain entities. | |
| C2.2 | Server actions: `createCustomer`, `updateCustomer`, `archiveCustomer` in `src/features/customers/actions/` | |
| C2.3 | Server actions: `createContact`, `updateContact`, `deleteContact`, `createAddress`, `updateAddress`, `deleteAddress` | |
| C2.4 | Customer list page: search (debounced, URL param), lifecycle/health/type filters (URL params), sort, pagination — all server-side | |
| C2.5 | Customer detail: Overview + Contacts + Addresses + Financial tabs wired. Edit sheets for contact/address CRUD. | |
| C2.6 | Referral tracking: "Referred by" combobox on create, referral count display on detail | |
| **C3** | **Wave 1b: Activity Timeline** (parallel with C2) | |
| C3.1 | `CustomerActivityService` at `src/domain/services/customer-activity.service.ts`: `log(input: ActivityInput): Promise<void>`. Domain service, no direct DB access — calls repository port. | |
| C3.2 | `ICustomerActivityRepository` port + `SupabaseCustomerActivityRepository` implementation. Append-only insert + paginated reads. | |
| C3.3 | Manual note server action: `addCustomerNote(customerId, content, relatedEntityType?, relatedEntityId?)` | |
| C3.4 | Activity tab UI: chronological feed, source icon per type, direction badge (inbound/outbound), linked entity as clickable badge, paginated (load-more), type-filter chips | |
| C3.5 | Quote server actions wired (4 events): `createQuote` → "Quote {{num}} created", `updateStatus→sent` → "sent to customer", `→accepted` → "accepted" (inbound), `→declined` → "declined" (inbound). All carry `customerId` from `quote.customerId`. See `spike-activity-wiring.md`. | |
| C3.6 | Job server actions wired (3 events): `createJob` → "created from Quote {{num}}", `updateJobLane` → "moved to {{lane}}", `completeJob` → "completed". Job entity needs `customerId` FK added (inherit from source quote). See `spike-activity-wiring.md`. | |
| C3.7 | Invoice server actions wired (4 events): `createInvoice`, `sendInvoice`, `recordPayment` (inbound), `markInvoiceOverdue`. All carry `customerId` from `invoice.customerId`. Note: distinct from `invoice.auditLog` (invoice-internal). See `spike-activity-wiring.md`. | |
| **C4** | **Wave 2a: Financial Management** (parallel with C5) | |
| C4.1 | Credit limit field + account balance query (sum of unpaid invoices by customer_id) — computed on read, not stored | |
| C4.2 | Account balance bar UI: current balance / credit limit, color-coded (green <50%, yellow 50-80%, red >80%) | |
| C4.3 | Tax exemption: toggle + expiry date + 30-day warning indicator. Auto-suppress tax line on invoice creation when exempt. | |
| C4.4 | Per-state tax exemptions tab: list by state, add/edit cert (number, doc URL, expiry, verified), PDF upload to Supabase storage | |
| C4.5 | Invoice creation: look up shipping state → check customer_tax_exemptions for that state → apply/skip tax accordingly | |
| **C5** | **Wave 2b: Intelligence Layer** (parallel with C4) | |
| C5.1 | Lifecycle auto-progression: domain rule function `computeLifecycleProgression(customer, orderHistory)` called from job completion and quote acceptance server actions. Returns new stage if trigger met. | |
| C5.2 | Health score domain service: `computeHealthScore(customer, orders)` → active/potentially-churning/churned. Runs on read (not stored separately — recomputed or updated on order events). | |
| C5.3 | Seasonal detection: dbt mart `customer_seasonality_mart` computes seasonal_score, seasonal_months[], pattern_strength. App reads via Drizzle `.existing()` view. Resolved by C7.4 — same established analytics pattern as existing dbt marts. | |
| C5.4 | Seasonal UI: indicator on customer detail ("Orders typically in [months]" + pattern_strength badge). List filter "Approaching season" (within 30 days). Manual override field on customer. | |
| C5.5 | Favorites cascade fix: rename-only refactor across 6 files — `EntityType` `'global'` → `'shop'`, `getGlobalFavoriteIds` → `getShopFavoriteIds`, 6 call sites in `SettingsColorsClient.tsx`, prop type in `RemovalConfirmationDialog.tsx`, display text in `InheritanceDetail.tsx`. `Color.isFavorite` stays as shop-level storage. No logic or data changes. See `spike-favorites-cascade.md`. | |
| C5.6 | Garment favorites per customer: Preferences tab CRUD. `CustomerRepository.getPreferences(id)` returns `{ favoriteStyleIds[], favoriteColorsByBrand{} }`. Quote garment selector reads these via customer context. | |
| **C6** | **Wave 3: Cross-Vertical Wiring** | |
| C6.1 | Quote form: customer combobox reads Supabase (replaces mock). On select → auto-fill shipping address (primary), billing address, payment terms, pricing tier, tax exemption status. | |
| C6.2 | Address snapshot: both `quote.ts` and `invoice.ts` currently lack snapshot fields — confirmed by spike. Wave 0 migration adds `shipping_address_snapshot jsonb` + `billing_address_snapshot jsonb` to quotes; `billing_address_snapshot jsonb` to invoices. Domain entities gain optional `shippingAddressSnapshot` + `billingAddressSnapshot` fields (typed against extended `addressSchema` from C1.3). Quote creation copies primary shipping; invoice creation copies primary billing. See `spike-address-snapshot.md`. | |
| C6.3 | Job: inherit customer_id FK from source quote on creation. Job detail shows customer name + linked. | |
| C6.4 | Invoice: customer_id FK, billing address snapshotted, payment terms auto-populated, tax exemption checked by shipping state. | |
| C6.5 | Customer detail Quotes/Jobs/Invoices tabs: read real linked records by customer_id | |
| C6.6 | Activity auto-logging hooks: C3.5–C3.7 are finalized here once quote/job/invoice server actions are confirmed (resolves ⚠️ from C3) | |
| **C7** | **Wave 4: dbt Models** (parallel, anytime after C1) | |
| C7.1 | `stg_customers` staging model: cast + rename from raw Supabase customers table | |
| C7.2 | `dim_customers` mart: SCD-style snapshot with current lifecycle, health, referral chain | |
| C7.3 | `fct_customer_orders` fact: one row per order per customer, with revenue + status | |
| C7.4 | `customer_seasonality_mart`: aggregate order history by customer + month, compute seasonal_score + pattern_strength (resolves C5.3 ⚠️) | |
| C7.5 | `customer_lifecycle_funnel` mart: cohort analysis — how many prospects convert, at what rate | |

## Flagged Unknowns — Spikes Required

Three ⚠️ items need investigation before implementation:

| Flag | Item | Spike | Why Unknown |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| C3.5–C3.7 | Quote/job/invoice server actions for activity wiring | `spike-activity-wiring.md` | Need to audit existing server actions in these verticals to know the exact call sites and data available at each point |
| C5.5 | Favorites cascade refactor (`customer.rules.ts` global→shop) | `spike-favorites-cascade.md` | `global` is baked into `EntityType` union + `propagateAddition`/`removeFromAll`/`getImpactPreview` — downstream effects on `SettingsColorsClient.tsx` and other callers unknown without reading all call sites |
| C6.2 | Address snapshot columns in quotes/invoices tables | `spike-address-snapshot.md` | Mock data may or may not have JSONB snapshot fields already. Need to confirm what exists vs. what needs adding to migration |
| C5.3 | Seasonal dbt mart | Folded into C7.4 | Not a code spike — well-understood dbt pattern. Mark resolved once C7.4 is built. |

## Gary Interview Questions

Questions to validate priorities and uncover preferences before building:

### Priority Validation
1. **The 9 tabs on customer detail** — Which tabs do you check most often when a customer calls? (Ranking: Activity, Contacts, Quotes, Jobs, Invoices, Financial, Addresses, Preferences, Overview)
2. **Credit limits** — Do you currently track how much any customer owes you? Is there a point where you'd stop extending credit? What's your gut number for a new customer?
3. **Tax exemption** — Do you have any customers that are tax-exempt? Do they ship to multiple states? Have you ever had to chase an expired certificate?

### Financial Terms
4. **Payment terms** — What terms do you actually use? COD only? Net-30 for any accounts? Do any customers have formal payment agreements?
5. **Pricing tiers** — Right now you have Standard/Preferred/Contract/Wholesale in the mock. Do those names match how you think about your customer categories?

### Activity & Communication
6. **Phone calls** — When a customer calls, how do you currently remember what was discussed? Notes app? Memory? Would a "quick note" button on the customer page be useful mid-call?
7. **Email** — If we could automatically file your Gmail emails with a customer into their timeline, would that matter? Or do you prefer to add notes manually?

### Seasonal & Intelligence
8. **Seasonal customers** — Do you have customers who only order at certain times of year (sports teams, holiday orgs)? Are there orders you've missed because you didn't reach out in time?
9. **Health indicators** — Would it help to see a red flag on customers you haven't heard from in a while? What "silence" period feels like a warning: 60 days? 90 days? 6 months?

### Garment Preferences
10. **Regular customers** — For your top 3-4 repeat customers, do they always order the same garment style? Same brand? Same colors? Would "River City always orders Bella+Canvas 3001 in black, navy, and gray" be useful to see when building their quote?

### Out-of-Scope Validation
11. **SMS** — Do you text customers? Would it matter if those texts showed up in the customer history?
12. **Portal** — If a customer could log in to check their order status and pay invoices online, would they use it? Are any of your customers asking for that now?

## Decision Points Log

| Decision | Choice | Reasoning |
| -------- | ------ | --------- |
| Shape selection | C (Core Platform + Parallel Extension Waves) | Parallel wave execution maximizes throughput on 1-week sprint with AI team. Schema in Wave 0 is the only true critical path dep. |
| Activity auto-logging mechanism | C3-B Server Action Orchestration | TypeScript-testable, no new infrastructure, aligns with existing server action pattern, no cross-repo coupling. |
| Communication integrations (email/SMS/voicemail) | Out of scope | Each is a micro-vertical. Schema supports them (source enum already has email/sms/voicemail). Integrations built later. |
| Seasonal detection | dbt mart (C7.4) + UI indicator | Follows established analytics architecture. App reads mart via Drizzle `.existing()`. Manual override field on customer for data-sparse cases. |
| Health score storage | Recomputed on read / updated on order events | Not a separate table. `computeHealthScore()` domain service called in repo read. Optionally cached in a `health_status` column updated by order completion triggers. |
| Address snapshot | JSONB copy at order/invoice creation time | ADR-002. Need spike to confirm existing columns. |
| Favorites cascade | Remove `global` EntityType → `shop` | ADR-005. Needs spike to understand full refactor surface. |
| Per-state tax scope | In scope (P1) | DecoNetwork doesn't have it. Legal/compliance need is real. Multi-state customers (sports leagues) need it now. |
| Credit limit scope | In scope (P1) | Only competitor with credit limits is DecoNetwork. Real business need — Gary needs to know when to stop extending credit. |
| CSV import / merge-dedup | Out of scope (P2) | Not needed for initial real-data launch. Seed data covers Gary's existing customers. |
