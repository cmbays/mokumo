# Mokumo — Improved Jobs & Production Journey

**Purpose**: Design the production management experience for Mokumo, addressing all 12 friction points from the current journey map
**Input**: Competitive analysis synthesis, journey map, user interview (12 questions)
**Status**: Complete — ready for scope definition and build

---

## Design Principles (From Discovery)

1. **Board is the single source of truth** — no separate dashboards, Today is a filter
2. **Universal lanes, not per-service lanes** — Ready/In Progress/Review/Blocked/Done works for all service types
3. **Service type is the primary visual** — color + icon, instantly scannable across the board
4. **Capacity awareness at the point of commitment** — help Gary make confident delivery date decisions
5. **Guardrails, not gates** — quality checkpoints that help without burdening
6. **Cards are command centers** — task checklists, action buttons, history feed, links to related entities
7. **Quick capture over forced structure** — scratch notes for lightweight logging
8. **Inferred intelligence** — productivity tracking from state transitions, not manual logging
9. **Conservative warnings only** — flag overbooking only when highly confident, never false positives
10. **Two horizontal sections** — Quotes row and Jobs row share the same vertical lanes

## Board Architecture

### Layout

```text

              └─────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

### Lane Definitions

| Lane            | Meaning                                 | Quote Context                         | Job Context                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Ready**       | Logged, not started yet                 | Phone call noted, need to build quote | Quote accepted, need to prep for production |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on                | Drafting/building the quote           | Screens being burned, shirts being printed  |
| **Review**      | Quality gate / approval pending         | Customer reviewing our quote          | QC check before shipping, customer sign-off |
| **Blocked**     | External dependency — nothing we can do | Waiting on customer decision/info     | Blanks not arrived, waiting on art approval |
| **Done**        | Work complete, still tracking           | Accepted → auto-generates Job card    | Shipped, may still need payment             |

### Review Lane

Configurable via settings (enabled by default). When enabled:

- Jobs MUST pass through Review before Done
- Review = quality checkpoint (QC checklist completed)
- Can also be used for customer sign-off on completed work
- If disabled, cards go directly from In Progress → Done

### Board-Level Controls

- **Time horizon selector**: 1 week / 2 weeks / 1 month (default: 2 weeks)
- **Filters**: Today | Service Type | Quotes vs Jobs | Risk Level
- **Capacity summary bar** (above board): Rush orders count, total quantity, due date distribution
- **What-if date picker**: Select potential due date → see work landscape between now and then

## Card Design

### Card (Closed — On Board)

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🟢 Screen Printing    [JD]      │  ← Service type color + icon, Assignee initials
│                                  │
│ Acme Corp — Company Tees         │  ← Customer + Job nickname
│ 200 shirts · 2 locations         │  ← Quantity + complexity indicator
│                                  │
│ Due: Feb 14 ●                    │  ← Due date, risk dot (green/orange/red)
│ ████████░░ 6/8 tasks             │  ← Task completion progress bar
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Visual encoding:**

- **Service type**: Card left-border color + small icon (🖨️ Screen, 🎨 DTF, 🧵 Embroidery)
- **Quantity**: Plain number + unit (shirts, hats, transfers)
- **Complexity**: Location count, screen count — shown as "2 locations" or "4 screens"
- **Due date**: Text date. Color-coded dot ONLY when at risk:
  - No dot = on track (> 3 days buffer)
  - 🟡 Orange = getting tight (estimated work ≈ remaining time)
  - 🔴 Red = at risk (estimated work > remaining time) or overdue
- **Task progress**: Mini progress bar showing completed/total canonical tasks
- **Assignee**: Initials badge in top-right corner (future-proofed, optional)

**Key features of detail view:**

- **Quick Actions**: Move lane, mark blocked, view invoice — one-click operations
- **Task checklist**: Canonical tasks per service type + custom tasks. Completing all tasks makes card eligible for next lane.
- **Notes feed**: Chronological feed mixing internal notes, customer messages, and system events. Each note tagged with visibility (internal/customer/system).
- **Linked entities**: Direct links to quote, invoice, customer record, attached files
- **Block reason**: When blocked, shows why and provides "Unblock" action

## Card Lifecycle

### Quote Lifecycle

```text
ENTRY: Quick capture (scratch note) or "New Quote" button

1. SCRATCH NOTE → Ready lane (Quotes row)
   • Minimum: just a text note ("John called, 200 black tees, wants by Friday")
   • Action button: "Create Quote from this"

2. BUILDING QUOTE → In Progress lane
   • Gary builds the quote using the quote form
   • Quote is in draft mode
   • Action button: "Send to Customer" (Phase 2: actual send. Phase 1: marks as sent)

3. CUSTOMER REVIEWING → Review lane (or Blocked lane)
   • Review: if we think of it as "customer needs to review"
   • Blocked: if we think of it as "waiting on external action"
   • User choice — either lane works. Default: Blocked (since it's external)

4. ACCEPTED → Done lane
   • Customer accepts the quote
   • Quote card gets "New" badge until Gary acknowledges
   • Action button: "Create Invoice & Job"
   • Card auto-clears from Done after job is created

5. DECLINED → Done lane (with "Declined" badge, eventually archives)
```

### Job Lifecycle

```text
ENTRY: Created from accepted quote (manual gate — configurable)

1. PREP NEEDED → Ready lane (Jobs row)
   • Job created with canonical tasks for service type
   • Canonical tasks auto-populated (e.g., screen printing: burn screens, check blanks, etc.)
   • Gary reviews, adjusts tasks if needed

2. WORK IN PROGRESS → In Progress lane
   • Gary/team working through tasks
   • Task completion progress bar updates on card
   • Sub-stage indicator shows current phase (e.g., "Screen Prep" or "Printing")
   • DTF rush orders can enter here directly with minimal tasks

3. QUALITY CHECK → Review lane
   • All production tasks complete
   • QC checklist must pass before moving to Done
   • If QC fails → back to In Progress with note

4. EXTERNAL BLOCK → Blocked lane (at any time)
   • Blanks not arrived
   • Waiting on art revision from customer
   • Equipment issue requiring vendor service
   • Block reason captured, timestamp logged

5. COMPLETE → Done lane
   • Shipped or picked up by customer
   • May still be awaiting payment (tracked via linked invoice)
   • Card stays in Done until payment received, then archives
```

## Capacity Awareness

### What-If Date Picker (Key Feature)

When Gary is on a call and needs to commit a delivery date:

1. Opens the **what-if tool** (always accessible from board header)
2. Picks a potential due date (e.g., "5 days from now")
3. System shows:
   - **Work landscape**: All cards due between now and that date
   - **By service type**: X screen printing jobs (Y shirts), Z DTF orders, W embroidery
   - **Complexity summary**: Total locations, total screens
   - **Rush orders**: Count of rush-flagged items
   - **Risk items**: Count of cards in Blocked or at-risk state
4. Gary makes informed gut call: "Yeah, we can take that" or "That would need to be a rush order"

### Overbooking Warnings (Conservative)

- Only triggered when system is **highly confident** capacity is exceeded
- Based on: total quantity due in time window vs historical daily output average
- **Never false positive** — better to not warn than to cry wolf
- Visual: subtle warning banner at top of board, dismissible
- Example: "Heads up: 1,200 shirts due by Thursday. Your weekly average is 800."

### Daily Output Tracking (Inferred)

- When a job moves to Done, system records: quantity completed, date, service type
- Over time, builds: daily output, weekly average, monthly trends
- **Optional end-of-day summary** (settings toggle):
  - "Today: 5 jobs completed (450 shirts). 20% above your weekly average!"
  - Positive, celebratory tone. Never punitive.
- Data feeds capacity calculations and overbooking warnings

## Notification System

### Quote Accepted Flow

1. Customer accepts quote (Phase 1: Gary marks it manually. Phase 2: customer portal)
2. **Email notification** → configured notification email
3. **In-app notification bell** → badge count increments
4. Click notification → opens quote card detail
5. Quote card in Done lane gets "New" indicator
6. Gary clicks "Create Invoice & Job" when ready
7. Job card appears in Ready lane

### Other Notifications (In-App Bell)

| Event                          | Notification                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Quote accepted                 | "Quote #Q-1024 accepted by John Smith"                       |
| Card blocked for 2+ days       | "Job #1024 has been blocked for 2 days (blanks not arrived)" |
| Due date approaching + at risk | "Job #1024 due in 2 days — 3 tasks remaining"                |
| All tasks completed            | "Job #1024 — all tasks complete, ready for QC"               |

---

## Service Type Handling

### Universal Lanes, Different Task Templates

The board lanes are universal. What differs per service type is the **canonical task list** that auto-populates when a job is created:

**Screen Printing Tasks:**

1. ☐ Art files finalized
2. ☐ Film positives printed
3. ☐ Screens burned (mesh count: \_\_\_)
4. ☐ Screens registered on press
5. ☐ Blanks received and counted
6. ☐ Press run complete
7. ☐ QC inspection passed
8. ☐ Packed and labeled

**DTF Tasks:**

1. ☐ Art files finalized
2. ☐ Gang sheet prepared
3. ☐ DTF printed
4. ☐ Transfers pressed (if applicable)
5. ☐ QC inspection passed
6. ☐ Packed and labeled

**Embroidery Tasks:**

1. ☐ Art files finalized
2. ☐ Design digitized (stitch file created)
3. ☐ Digitizer machine set up
4. ☐ Blanks received and counted
5. ☐ Embroidery run complete
6. ☐ QC inspection passed
7. ☐ Packed and labeled

**Key**: Steps can be skipped (repeat customer = screens already exist), tasks can be manually added/removed per job. But the defaults ensure nothing gets forgotten.
