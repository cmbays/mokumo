# Changelog

All notable changes to Mokumo will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Customer form sheet now shows safe error messages**: unknown or security-sensitive API errors (e.g. `internal_error`) display a user-friendly fallback message instead of raw backend text; known safe codes continue to surface the server message verbatim. (#529)
- **Profile switcher now shows server error messages**: rate-limited and other known API errors display the backend's message verbatim in a toast instead of a generic fallback. Both the direct switch and the unsaved-changes confirmation path are fixed. (#469)
- **QR code on Connect Your Team card now renders correctly**: replaced `onMount` with a reactive `$effect` so the QR code re-renders when the IP URL loads asynchronously. Added null guard, loading placeholder, and error fallback state. (#470)

### Added

- **Desktop server now binds `127.0.0.1:0`** (OS-assigned ephemeral loopback port) instead of `0.0.0.0:6565`, eliminating predictable-port scanning. `window.__MOKUMO_API_BASE__` is injected via Tauri `initialization_script` before SvelteKit mounts. Tauri capability ACL updated from 11 hardcoded ports to `http://127.0.0.1:*/*` wildcard. `apiBase()` typed accessor available at `apps/web/src/lib/api/base.ts` for future fetch call sites. **Note — LAN access**: the desktop app is now loopback-only; employee devices on LAN must use a browser on the shop machine until `mokumo-server` ships (#510). (#484)
- **`mokumo migrate status`**: New CLI subcommand that shows the current schema version, lists all applied migrations with timestamps, and lists any pending (unapplied) migrations. Useful for advanced users and CI pipelines that need to verify migration state before upgrades. (#406)
- **`--verbose` / `--quiet` global CLI flags**: `-v` sets the server tracing level to `debug`, `-vv` to `trace`, and `-q` suppresses all output except errors. Accepted in any position on the command line (global Clap args); override `RUST_LOG` for the server console layer on startup. (#407)
- **Boot-time install guard**: Health endpoint reports `install_ok` flag and `status: "degraded"` when the flag is false. Protected routes return 423 `DEMO_SETUP_REQUIRED` when the demo admin account is missing, inactive, soft-deleted, or has an empty password hash. Reset demo data to restore access. (#342)
- **Storage metrics in health and diagnostics**: Health endpoint reports `storage_ok` flag (false when disk space is low or the active database needs a VACUUM). Diagnostics endpoint gains `wal_size_bytes`, `vacuum_needed` per profile, and `disk_warning` on the system object. Doctor CLI now uses the shared `diagnose_database()` helper. PRAGMA optimize runs after each migration, every 2 hours, and at graceful shutdown. (#411)
- **Shop logo upload**: `POST /api/shop/logo` accepts PNG, JPEG, or WebP (≤ 2 MB, ≤ 2048×2048 px). `GET /api/shop/logo` serves the file publicly. `DELETE /api/shop/logo` removes it. Setup status includes `logo_url` for sidebar display. Sidebar profile trigger shows the custom logo or falls back to a Store glyph. Backup and restore preserve the logo file alongside the database. (#283)
- **Support-facing health surface**: `GET /api/diagnostics` now includes system-level signals — memory usage, disk space, hostname — so support can perform first-pass triage without SSH access. Build commit SHA is included for version tracking. (#319)
- **Diagnosis bundle export**: New `GET /api/diagnostics/bundle` endpoint assembles a downloadable ZIP containing app logs (up to 7 days, sensitive values scrubbed) and a `metadata.json` runtime snapshot. The Diagnostics card on the System Settings page gains an "Export Bundle" button. (#316)
- **Offline startup validation**: BDD scenarios and Hurl smoke test confirm the server boots and serves the internal shop API with zero internet access. mDNS registration failure degrades gracefully (logged warning, `mdns_active: false` in `/api/server-info` and `/api/diagnostics`) without blocking boot. (#315)
- **Support-visible diagnostics endpoint and settings card**: new `GET /api/diagnostics` returns app version, database schema/file size/WAL mode for both profiles, runtime state (uptime, active profile, setup flags, LAN host/port, mDNS), and OS family/arch. System Settings now renders a Diagnostics card with a "Copy as Markdown" button so shop owners can share state when troubleshooting. (#318)
- **Open Existing Shop**: welcome screen now includes a third button to restore a production shop from an existing `.db` backup file. The file is validated (application ID, integrity, schema compatibility), copied to the production slot, and the server restarts. Users then log in with their existing credentials. (#282)
- **Graceful shutdown with drain timeout**: Server now exits within 10 seconds of receiving a shutdown signal, even with in-flight requests. CLI handles both SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM on Unix. Desktop wraps server drain with a 10-second timeout. (#312)
- **Process lock with port info**: Lock file stores the bound port so conflict messages show the URL and suggest checking the system tray. `reset-db` conflict message includes the port. (#311)
- **mDNS retry with backoff**: When LAN discovery fails at startup, automatic retries at 60s/120s/300s intervals until registration succeeds or the server shuts down. (#314)
- **WebSocket shutdown broadcast**: Connected clients receive a `server_shutting_down` event before the close frame, enabling frontend disconnect banners.
- **System tray**: Closing the window hides to tray instead of quitting. Server keeps running in the background. Left-click or "Reopen Desktop App" menu item restores the window. "Quit Mokumo" triggers clean shutdown with confirmation dialog showing connected client count. macOS dock icon hides/restores automatically. (#408)
- **Tray status and info**: Dynamic tray icon (green/yellow/red) reflects mDNS status. Tray menu shows port, IP, mDNS hostname. "Open in Browser" menu item. Tooltip shows server URL and connected client count. (#408)
- **Quit flow**: Quit from tray menu or Cmd+Q/Alt+F4 shows confirmation dialog with client count. When window is hidden, sends OS notification instead. Linux no-tray degradation: close button triggers quit confirmation. (#408)
- **Connect Your Team card**: QR code and connection URLs on the dashboard with mDNS status indicator, troubleshooting guidance, and first-run nudge for new installs.
- **WebSocket disconnect banner**: Employees see a status banner when the server disconnects, with reconnection indicator and brief "Reconnected" confirmation.
- **Unsaved changes guard**: forms now block navigation (sidebar links, back button), browser tab close, and Tauri window close when there are unsaved changes. A confirmation dialog with "Cancel" / "Leave anyway" prevents accidental data loss. Applies to the customer form, setup wizard, and any future `use:formDirty` forms. (#420)
- **Structured JSON file logging** with daily rotation and 7-day retention (`max_log_files(7)`). Log files written to `{data_dir}/logs/` as newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) including timestamp, level, target, span context, and message fields. Console output remains human-readable text. (#412, #317)
- **Version CLI**: `mokumo --version` prints the version string; `mokumo version` prints extended build info including git hash, build date, target platform, and Rust version. (#405)
- **`mokumo backup` CLI subcommand** creates a manual database backup using the SQLite Online Backup API. Supports `--output <path>` for custom location, verifies integrity with `PRAGMA integrity_check`, and prints path + size on success. Safe to run while the server is running. (#403)
- **`mokumo restore <path>` CLI subcommand** restores the database from a backup file. Verifies backup integrity before restoring, creates a safety backup of the current database, removes WAL sidecars, and refuses to run while the server is active (process lock check). (#404)
- **SQLite `auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL`** PRAGMA with automatic upgrade of existing databases via one-time `VACUUM`. Ensures database files shrink after row deletions. (#424)
- **SQLite `mmap_size = 268435456`** (256 MB) PRAGMA for read performance via memory-mapped I/O. (#424)
- **`mokumo doctor` CLI subcommand** with `--fix` flag for database maintenance — reports auto_vacuum status, freelist fragmentation, and reclaims free pages on demand. (#424)
- **HTTP security headers**: every response now includes `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-XSS-Protection: 0`, and `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`. `Strict-Transport-Security` is set conditionally when behind Cloudflare Tunnel. (#380)
- **Branded error page** shows the Mokumo logo, status code, and human-readable message for 400/401/403/404/5xx errors with navigation back to the dashboard.
- **Routing contract tests** verify unknown `/api/*` paths return JSON 404 and wrong HTTP methods return JSON 405 instead of silently serving SPA HTML. (#384)
- **Method-not-allowed fallback** returns structured JSON 405 responses for wrong HTTP methods on all API endpoints. (#384)

### Fixed

- **WebSocket disconnect banner on server death**: the banner now reliably fires when the server process is killed (SIGKILL), not just on graceful shutdown. A liveness timer (75 s, 2.5× the heartbeat interval) force-closes and reconnects the WebSocket when the server stops responding, covering silent-death and network partition scenarios. (#471)
- **Restore flow robustness**: rollback failures during restore now propagate as 500 errors with clear messages instead of silently leaving the filesystem in an inconsistent state. Sentinel write and rollback file deletions are now fully async (`tokio::fs`). Large file restores no longer time out (backup now completes in a single step). SQLite errors during integrity and schema checks now surface as `DatabaseCorrupt` (422) rather than generic 500. (#476)
- **bdd-lint exit code** now fails when dead specs exceed a configurable threshold (`--max-dead-specs`), enabling it to function as a blocking CI gate. Previously always exited 0 regardless of findings. (#385)

### CI

- **Gitleaks secret scanning**: pre-commit hook via lefthook and CI gate in `quality.yml` block PR merges when secrets are detected. Custom rules for Mokumo-specific patterns (`MOKUMO_SECRET`, `MOKUMO_API_KEY`, Stripe keys). (#413)

### Changed

- **Port exhaustion error message** now suggests `--port` flag and closing conflicting applications instead of a generic bind error. (#313)
- **`no-explicit-any` lint rule** promoted from `warn` to `error` so type holes fail CI instead of silently accumulating. (#386)
- **CI quality gates** `bdd-lint` and `test-storybook` promoted from advisory to blocking — failures now prevent PR merge. `mutation-ts` remains advisory pending baseline stabilization. (#385)

- **Settings Shop page** LAN URL and IP address display now use the shared `CopyableUrl` component, removing duplicated inline copy logic. (#162)
- **Dashboard heading** now shows the configured shop name (falls back to "Your Shop" if none set). (#331)
- **Dashboard Getting Started card** now differentiates demo vs. production mode: demo users see a contextual CTA to explore sample data or switch to their production shop. (#331)
- **Shop Settings** subtitle updated to "Your shop details and network access." and now includes a read-only Shop Name card showing the mDNS slug. (#331)
- **System Settings** replaces the placeholder EmptyState with a plain h1 + subtitle: "Demo mode and profile switching." (#331)
- **Session invalidation on deploy**: `AuthUser::Id` changed from `i64` to `ProfileUserId(SetupMode, i64)` (compound user ID for dual-DB routing). Any sessions created before this deploy are invalidated on first request. Pre-release with no active users — one-time logout only. (#276)

### Fixed

- **Lock poisoning crash loop**: replaced `std::sync::RwLock` with `parking_lot::RwLock` in server state to prevent cascading panics if a write-side panic poisons the lock. (#374)
- Enter key now submits the regenerate recovery codes dialog; previously required a mouse click on the Regenerate button. (#278)
- `GET /api/setup-status` now returns `setup_mode: null` on a fresh install (when `setup_complete` is false) instead of always returning the current profile mode. (#348)
- `GET /api/setup-status` no longer aliases `production_setup_complete` from the active profile's setup state; it now queries the production database directly so the field is accurate when the demo profile is active. (#290)
- `GET /api/setup-status` now correctly returns `is_first_launch: false` after the setup wizard completes, even when no profile switch occurred first (e.g. scripted onboarding or direct API use). (#291)
- `GET /api/setup-status` now returns `setup_mode: null` on a fresh production install before the setup wizard has run, instead of incorrectly returning `"production"`. (#346)
- `reset-db` CLI now targets the correct profile database (`demo/mokumo.db` by default); use `--production` flag to reset the production profile with a stronger confirmation prompt (#258)

### Added

- **System Settings** now shows a "Production Mode — Active" indicator when running outside demo mode, symmetric to the existing demo-mode section. (#306)
- **Database identity guard**: Mokumo now rejects SQLite files that are not Mokumo databases at startup. A non-zero `PRAGMA application_id` that doesn't match Mokumo's registered value (`0x4D4B4D4F`) produces a clear error: "The database at {path} is not a Mokumo database. Check your --data-dir setting." (#308)
- **Schema compatibility guard**: Startup now detects when the database was created by a newer version of Mokumo (downgrade scenario). Demo databases are silently recreated from the bundled sidecar; production databases abort with an actionable message directing users to upgrade or restore from backup. (#309)
- **Human-readable migration error messages**: Migration failures now include the database path and a user-friendly message. Technical `DbErr` internals go to logs only. (#308)
- **PRAGMA `application_id` stamp**: New migration `m20260404_000000_set_pragmas` stamps all databases with `0x4D4B4D4F` ("MKMO"), making Mokumo databases identifiable by any SQLite browser tool.
- **PRAGMA `user_version` stamps**: Each migration stamps the schema version (1–7) for diagnostic visibility. The value is logged at startup and visible in SQLite browser tools.
- **Native error dialog on startup failure**: The Tauri desktop app now shows a native OS error dialog (NSAlert on macOS, MessageBox on Windows) when the server fails to initialize, before the webview opens.
- **Typed `server-error` Tauri event**: Restart-loop startup failures now emit a `ServerStartupError` event to the frontend webview for future recovery UI handling.

- Profile switching: `POST /api/profile/switch` endpoint switches the active profile between demo and production without a server restart. Rate-limited to 3 switches per 15 minutes. (#262)
- `GET /api/setup-status` now returns `is_first_launch`, `production_setup_complete`, and `shop_name` fields to support the welcome screen and profile switcher UX. (#262)
- shadcn-svelte components: hover-card, carousel, drawer, menubar, calendar with Storybook stories (#247)
- Custom components: status-dot, spinner, split-button, choicebox, error-message, description, theme-switcher with Storybook stories (#247)
- Composite blocks: login-with-image, date-picker-input, sidebar-icon-only with Storybook stories (#247)
- Project banner component with success/warning/error/info variants — general-purpose notification bar (#247)
- Badge status variants: success, warning, error, info — uses design system status color tokens (#247)

- Debug endpoints for connection count and broadcast testing (debug builds only)
- 9 BDD scenarios covering connection, broadcast, and shutdown behavior
- 12 Vitest tests covering client reconnection, backoff, and error handling
- Origin header validation on WebSocket endpoint to prevent cross-site hijacking
- Standardized API error responses with `ErrorBody` wire format (`code`, `message`, `details`)
- Domain error hierarchy: `DomainError` (core) -> `AppError` (api) -> `ErrorBody` (wire)
- Internal/database error redaction — sensitive details logged server-side, generic message returned to clients
- `PageParams` with clamped pagination (page >= 1, per_page 1..100, defaults 1/25)

### Changed

- Auth and demo handlers now use `AppError` for consistent error responses with `Cache-Control: no-store` and structured `ErrorBody` (#248)
- Dashboard LAN URL now shows real server info from `/api/server-info` instead of `window.location.origin`
- Setup wizard hides token field when pre-filled via URL parameter, reveals on error
- Activity log entries now record the authenticated user's ID and type instead of hardcoded "system" for customer mutations
- Session store now uses a separate `sessions.db` database independent of the active profile; upgrading requires re-login
- Default bind address to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) for both desktop and CLI — enables LAN access and mDNS registration by default (use `--host 127.0.0.1` for local-only)

### Fixed

- Forgot password step 2 now tells Desktop users where to find the recovery file; Desktop app auto-opens the file on submission (#260)
- Forgot password now shows an error when the email address is not found, instead of silently advancing to step 2 (#260)
- Demo guide slides now show real screenshots instead of invisible HTML comment placeholders (#228)
- Demo reset shutdown delay increased from 100ms to 500ms to prevent truncated responses (#218)
- `demo-smoke` CI job now gates PR merge via verdict check (was `continue-on-error`, now enforced) (#218)
- Demo Guide button now opens in the system browser when running inside Tauri desktop app (#227)
- Print button on recovery codes screen now opens the system print dialog inside Tauri desktop app (#259)
- `waitForServer` no longer swallows unexpected errors (malformed URL, DNS failure) — only retries connection-refused and abort-timeout (#221)
- Timeout error message now includes the last error seen for easier debugging
- Logout button now calls `POST /api/auth/logout` to destroy the server session before redirecting to login, with error toast on failure (#230)
- Customer list now refreshes automatically after creating, editing, or archiving a customer (#231)
- Archiving all customers no longer strands users on the empty state — "Show archived" toggle is visible when archived customers exist (#229)
- `reset-db` no longer fails when the recovery directory (e.g. `~/Desktop`) is unreadable due to macOS permissions — the scan is skipped with a warning instead of aborting the entire reset (#226)
- Phone number and address fields now validate format on both frontend and backend — phone rejects non-phone characters, address rejects purely special-character strings (#232)
- Recovery code redemption now retries on any SQLite contention error (not just the update step), preventing "database is locked" failures under concurrent access (#207)
- TOCTOU port race in E2E test infrastructure: `startAxumServer` now parses the actual bound port from Axum's log output instead of assuming the probed port was claimed successfully (#210)
- Customer mutations (create, update, soft-delete) now execute within atomic transactions — the mutation and its activity log entry either both persist or neither does, preventing orphaned records
- `ErrorBody.details` now always serializes as `null` when absent (not omitted from JSON)
- Settings LAN port E2E test no longer flaky in CI — replaced manual element iteration with auto-retrying Playwright assertion
