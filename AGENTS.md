# Mokumo Agent Notes

- Use `$ops-conventions` whenever work here needs pipeline notes, board state, decision records, closeout logs, or other private ops artifacts in `/Users/cmbays/github/ops`.
- Use `$pr-review-hygiene` for GitHub PR reviews and disposable review worktrees.
- Cross-repo reference note: `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`.
- Global skills: `~/.codex/skills/ops-conventions`, `~/.codex/skills/pr-review-hygiene`.
- This repo uses a shared Cargo target directory via `.cargo/config.toml`; let worktrees inherit it normally.
- Preserve any worktree the user identifies as active.

## Repo Context

- Architecture: Moon monorepo with `apps/web` (SvelteKit), `apps/mokumo-server` (headless Axum binary), `apps/mokumo-desktop` (Tauri), and Rust crates under `crates/` (`kikan`, `mokumo-shop`, `kikan-cli`, `kikan-socket`, etc.). The Moon `shop:` project points at `crates/mokumo-shop`.
- Testing: prefer repo tasks over ad hoc commands. `moon check --all` is the broadest validation path; `moon run web:test` covers frontend tests; `moon run shop:test` covers backend unit + integration tests; `moon run shop:test-bdd shop:test-bdd-api` covers both shop and HTTP BDD harnesses. BDD suites live under `crates/kikan/tests/` and `crates/mokumo-shop/tests/`; Playwright BDD coverage lives under `apps/web/tests`.
- Quality context: `COVERAGE.md` documents `cargo-llvm-cov`; `tools/bdd-lint` enforces BDD spec and step-definition hygiene.
- Safety: do not push directly to `main`, do not modify `.github/workflows/*` unless the task clearly requires CI changes, and keep private operational state in `ops`, not this repo.

## Synchronized-Docs

Two mechanisms keep code and prose in sync. Both live here so a contributor with one change in hand can find the other one they owe.

### A. AUTO-GEN marker registry

Files with `<!-- AUTO-GEN:name -->` / `<!-- /AUTO-GEN:name -->` markers have sections owned by the `docs-gen` binary (`tools/docs-gen`). **Never edit between these markers by hand** — the generator overwrites them on the next run.

After changing any source listed below, regenerate and verify before pushing:

```bash
moon run docs:gen
git diff --exit-code   # must be empty
```

The registry of every owned section lives in `tools/docs-gen/src/registry.rs`. Adding a new section is two changes: write a `render_*` function and append a `Section` entry. The marker pair must already exist in the target file.

| Marker | Source | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `AUTO-GEN:msrv` | `Cargo.toml` (`workspace.package.rust-version`) | `README.md` |

CI enforces this via the `docs-drift` job: every PR regenerates all AUTO-GEN sections and fails if any target file differs from HEAD.

### B. Paired-files rules

When a class of code changes, a matching prose doc must change in the same PR. These rules are enforced socially today (PR review + checklist); CI enforcement is tracked in [issue #776](https://github.com/breezy-bays-labs/mokumo/issues/776).

| When this changes… | …update this in the same PR | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Trust-boundary code: auth handlers, control / data plane split, container mount config, `DeploymentMode` posture | [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) | The threat-model document and the boundary code share one truth. A code change that shifts a boundary without a doc update silently moves the trust contract. |
| New `pub` domain entity, repository trait, service, or wire-type under `crates/mokumo-*/` | [`LANGUAGE.md`](LANGUAGE.md) (vertical glossary) | The vertical glossary is the entry point for new contributors looking up shop-domain vocabulary. A new term that lacks an entry sends the reader to read the source. |
| New `pub` platform entity, repository trait, service, or wire-type under `crates/kikan/`, `crates/kikan-events/`, `crates/kikan-mail/`, `crates/kikan-scheduler/`, `crates/kikan-socket/`, `crates/kikan-spa-sveltekit/`, `crates/kikan-tauri/`, `crates/kikan-cli/`, `crates/kikan-types/` | [`crates/kikan/LANGUAGE.md`](crates/kikan/LANGUAGE.md) (platform glossary) | Same rationale, kikan-side. The kikan glossary is the file that travels with the crate post-extraction; keeping it in sync at every PR avoids a one-shot reconciliation later. |
| Architectural change touching the planes, the multi-tenant DB layout, the deployment posture, or the doc-set itself | [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) and (when structural) [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) | `CONTEXT.md` is the doc map; if a new doc lands or an existing one moves, the map must reflect it. `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the structural source of truth; section §11 also tracks ADRs by Y-statement. |
