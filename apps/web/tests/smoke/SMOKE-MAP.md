# SMOKE-MAP — E2E Harness Traceability

> Each row maps a SMOKE-NN ID to its spec path (or unit test path / follow-up issue),
> disposition, and notes. This file is the canonical traceability artifact for the
> manual smoke checklist.
>
> CI lint (`tests/smoke/ci-lint.sh`): ripgrep every `SMOKE-\d{2}[a-z]?` in the codebase
> and `tests/manual/MANUAL_SMOKE.md`; assert each resolves to a row here and each
> row's path or issue exists.
>
> - `automated` + `covered-by-unit` dispositions must resolve to an existing path.
> - `manual` + `needs-computer-use` dispositions must resolve to `MANUAL_SMOKE.md`
>   or a filed GitHub issue URL.
