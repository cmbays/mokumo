Feature: Welcome screen — Open Existing Shop

  On a fresh install, the welcome screen offers "Open Existing Shop" as a
  third option. This lets a shop owner restore from an existing .db backup
  file instead of starting fresh or exploring the demo.

  # --- Welcome screen CTA ---

  Scenario: Welcome screen shows "Open Existing Shop" button
    Given I am on the welcome screen
    Then I see an "Open Existing Shop" button
    And the "Open Existing Shop" button has secondary/outline styling

  Scenario: "Open Existing Shop" is the third button
    Given I am on the welcome screen
    Then the button order is "Set Up My Shop", "Explore Demo", "Open Existing Shop"

    Given I am on the welcome screen
    When I click "Open Existing Shop"
    Then all three buttons are disabled

  # --- Validation phase ---

    Given I selected a .db file via the file picker
    Then I see a "Validating your database..." message with a spinner
    And a validation request is sent to the server

  Scenario: Valid file shows confirmation screen

    When validation succeeds

    And I see "Valid Mokumo database" with a success indicator
    And I see a credential warning "You'll need your login credentials from this database"
    And I see an "Import and Restart" button

  Scenario: Invalid file shows error with guidance

  Scenario: Incompatible schema shows update guidance
    Given I selected a .db file from a newer Mokumo version
    When validation fails with "schema_incompatible"
    Then I see an error message advising to update Mokumo

  Scenario: "Choose Different File" re-opens the file picker
    Given validation has failed for a selected file
    When I click "Choose Different File"
    Then the file picker opens again

  # --- Import phase ---

  Scenario: "Import and Restart" triggers the restore
    Given I see the confirmation screen with a valid file

    Then I see a spinner with "Importing your shop data..."
    And a restore request is sent to the server

  Scenario: Import failure shows error with recovery options
    Given I clicked "Import and Restart"
    When the restore request fails
    Then I see an error message
    And I see a "Try Again" button
    And I see a "Back to Welcome" link

  Scenario: "Try Again" after import failure re-opens file picker
    Given the import has failed
    When I click "Try Again"
    Then the file picker opens again

  # --- Restart phase ---

  Scenario: Successful import shows restarting state then redirects to login
    Given I clicked "Import and Restart"

    When I dismiss the banner
    Then the banner is no longer visible

  # --- Direct navigation guard ---

    Then I am redirected to "/welcome"

  # --- Rate limiting ---
