Feature: Customer create and edit forms

  A slide-in sheet for creating new customers and editing existing ones.
  The same form handles both modes: empty for create, pre-populated for edit.
  Validation runs client-side for immediate feedback; the server is authoritative
  and its errors are mapped back to the relevant form fields.

  # --- Create ---

    Given I am on the Customers page

    Then I see a "created" toast notification

  Scenario: Display name is required
    Given I open the create customer form
    When I leave "Display name" empty
    And I submit the form
