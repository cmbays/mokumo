# Quality Framework

Mokumo is self-hosted software running critical business data. Quality discipline here is what makes the product trustworthy at all. This document explains what CI enforces, what we measure, and what we plan to add.

## The five-phase quality loop

Every code change flows through a five-phase loop. Each phase catches a different class of defect; skipping phases means those defects ship.

1. **Acceptance scenarios** — Gherkin `.feature` files describe new behavior, confirmed failing before implementation.
2. **TDD red-green-refactor** — unit tests until scenarios pass.
3. **CRAP analysis** — keep function-level complexity-risk under threshold.
4. **Mutation testing** — every surviving mutant gets a test.
5. **Architecture enforcement** — dependency direction + boundary lint.

Each phase has a tool:

| Phase | Rust | TypeScript |
|---|---|---|
| Acceptance | `cucumber-rs` + `axum-test` | `quickpickle` + `@quickpickle/playwright` |
| TDD | `cargo-nextest` | `vitest` + `vitest-browser-svelte` |
| CRAP | `crap4rs` + `cargo-llvm-cov` | `crap4ts` |
| Mutation | `cargo-mutants` | `Stryker` (retired pre-users) |
| Architecture | Cargo workspace + `mod` visibility | `dependency-cruiser` + `eslint-plugin-boundaries` |

Phases 1–2 run every cycle. Phases 3–5 run in CI on every PR.

## What CI enforces on every PR

When you open a pull request, these gates run:

- **Unit + integration tests** pass on all target platforms.
- **BDD scenarios** (`cargo test --test bdd --features bdd`) pass.
- **Clippy** clean with `-D warnings`.
- **Formatter** clean (`cargo fmt --check`).
- **CRAP** — no function above threshold. Refactor-heavy PRs opt into a stricter `ci:crap-delta` gate that catches sub-threshold regressions.
- **Architecture invariants** — six checks enforcing the kikan/mokumo layering pass on main.
- **BDD staleness lint** — scenarios referencing renamed symbols are flagged.
- **Security** — dependency audit, dependency review, secret scanning.

## What we measure

Beyond pass/fail gates, we track metrics whose direction matters as much as the absolute value:

- Coverage (`cargo-llvm-cov`).
- Mutation kill rate (`cargo-mutants`, changed-files scope).
- CRAP count over threshold.
- Module size (longest function; count of modules over 300 lines).
- Architecture violations (must be zero).

Shipping soon: a PR comment bot that surfaces these deltas inline so every change makes its effect on the codebase visible.

## What's planned

A living roadmap of quality tooling improvements, grouped by the question each answers:

**Are my tests testing real behavior?**
- `scrap4rs` — static no-op test detection. Rust equivalent of Uncle Bob's [`scrap`](https://github.com/unclebob/scrap) (originally for speclj). Catches tests with no assertions, tautological asserts, and surface-only I/O checks.
- `/review-feature` — agent skill that reviews `.feature` files for the "two developers would implement the same thing" quality bar.

**Are all my behaviors specified?**
- Public-API spec audit — reports which `pub` items are never exercised by any BDD scenario.
- Handler ↔ scenario map — for every axum route, which scenarios cover it.

**Is my code reachable and used?**
- Unused `pub` items lint — Rust-ecosystem gap; catches exports with zero inbound references from anywhere in the workspace.

**Is the system trending better or worse?**
- Metrics-PR comment bot — sticky PR comment with coverage, CRAP, mutation, module-size deltas vs. main.
- Mutation-per-scenario map — which scenarios are catching mutants, and which are effectively integration-level no-ops.

**Can I trust the quality signal itself?**
- Orphan-test lint — flags any `[[test]]` harness not wired into CI. (Added after we discovered a BDD suite silently failing on main for several sessions because no CI job ran it — see [#647](https://github.com/breezy-bays-labs/mokumo/issues/647).)

## Philosophy

Two principles inform how we use these tools:

1. **Measure, don't review.** AI-generated code is tested, measured, and mutation-scored the same as human code. CRAP, mutation score, module size, architecture violations — these are the review. Agent-written code that clears the bars is merged; agent-written code that doesn't is fixed until it does.

2. **Adversarial distance.** Where feasible, the agent that writes tests is distinct from the agent that makes them pass. This prevents the two from colluding (an agent tempted to weaken a test to pass a flaky implementation, or vice versa). The discipline is evolving; the goal is that every important gate has at least two independent processes defending it.

Both borrow directly from [Uncle Bob Martin's](https://x.com/unclebobmartin) recent AI-era quality writings.

## For contributors

If you're opening a PR:

- Write the `.feature` file first. Confirm the scenario fails against main. Then implement.
- Run the loop locally: `cargo nextest run`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test --features bdd --test bdd`.
- CRAP over threshold? Refactor before opening the PR. If the refactor is the point of the PR, apply the `ci:crap-delta` label so the delta gate runs.
- Mutation survivors in new code? Write tests to kill them.
- Architecture violation in CI? Fix at the boundary, not by widening the exception list — the invariants encode load-bearing structural decisions.

The quality framework protects the shop owner running mokumo in their business, not the PR author. Optimize for their trust, not for the green checkmark.
