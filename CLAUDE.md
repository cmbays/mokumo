# Mokumo — CLAUDE.md

Production management software for decorated apparel shops. Full garment lifecycle:
Quote → Artwork Approval → Production → Shipping → Invoice.

**Architecture**: Self-hosted SvelteKit + Rust (Axum) binary. Shops download, run, own their data.

## Commands

All commands go through Moon. Never run raw `cargo`/`pnpm` directly unless debugging a failure.

```bash
moon run web:dev          # SvelteKit dev server
moon run web:build        # Build SvelteKit frontend (adapter-static)
moon run web:test         # Frontend tests (Vitest)
moon run web:check        # SvelteKit type-check (svelte-check)
moon run web:preview      # Preview production build
moon run api:dev          # Axum backend with auto-reload (depends on web:build)
moon run api:build        # Build Rust backend (depends on web:build)
moon run api:test         # Backend tests (cargo test)
moon run api:lint         # Clippy lints
moon run api:fmt          # Check Rust formatting (cargo fmt --check)
moon run api:fmt-write    # Apply Rust formatting (cargo fmt)
moon run api:gen-types    # Generate TypeScript from Rust structs (ts-rs)
moon run api:coverage     # Rust coverage report (JSON, used by CI)
moon run api:coverage-report  # Rust coverage report (HTML, local dev)
moon run api:smoke            # Hurl HTTP smoke tests (requires running server + hurl CLI)
moon run api:db-prepare   # Prepare SQLx offline cache (CI)
moon run api:deny         # Supply-chain audit (advisories, licenses, sources)
moon check --all          # Full CI: lint, test, typecheck, build across all projects
```

Underlying tools: `cargo` (Rust), `pnpm` (SvelteKit). Use directly only when diagnosing Moon task failures.

## Session Startup

- **Host sessions**: code-modifying work uses `claude --worktree` for automatic isolation. If not launched with `--worktree`, use the `EnterWorktree` tool to create one before making changes.
- **Container sessions (cmux/Docker)**: the container **is** the worktree — do NOT run `claude --worktree`, `EnterWorktree`, or `git worktree add` inside `/workspace`. Git writes the new worktree's metadata with container-only paths (e.g. `gitdir: /workspace/...`) into the bind-mounted `.git/worktrees/`, the host sees those entries as `prunable`, and any host `git worktree prune` wipes them — silently breaking every git-backed tool (`moon`, `lefthook`, `gh`) in whichever container was using that metadata. Parallelism inside a container uses sub-agents that share the same `/workspace`; for a genuinely separate workspace, stop and spin up a second host-created worktree in its own container.
- **Never push to main directly** — always branch + PR
- **Commit+push after every logical chunk** — never leave work local-only
- **Run `moon run api:deny` after touching Cargo.toml or Cargo.lock** — catches advisory, license, and supply-chain issues before CI
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** — add user-facing changes (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`) to the `## Unreleased` section in each PR
- **New API endpoints require a `.hurl` file** — add `tests/api/<domain>/<endpoint>.hurl` in the same PR. Error shape is `{"code": "...", "message": "...", "details": null}` — assert on `$.code`, not `$.error`
- Read-only sessions do not need a worktree

## Architecture

Mokumo is a kikan-grafted application. Three architectural boundaries:

1. **Engine / Application** (`kikan` ↔ `mokumo-shop`) — see `ops/decisions/mokumo/adr-kikan-engine-vocabulary.md`. The `kikan` crate is the Engine: tenancy, migrations, transport, auth, event bus, mailer, scheduler. `mokumo-shop` is the Application: shop domain, HTTP routes, migrations, business rules. They fuse through the `Graft` trait at compile time.
2. **Control plane / Data plane** — see `ops/decisions/mokumo/adr-control-plane-data-plane-split.md` and `adr-tauri-http-not-ipc.md`. Control plane = admin surface (diagnostics, backup, tenant management, bootstrap). Data plane = business endpoints (customers, quotes, orders). Both are HTTP-backed Axum routes; the control plane subset is served additionally on a Unix domain socket with mode 0600 as a capability-based admin channel.
3. **Application / Extensions** (`mokumo-shop` ↔ `crates/extensions/*`) — see `ops/decisions/mokumo/adr-mokumo-extensions.md`. Decoration techniques (screen printing, embroidery, DTF, DTG) compose into `mokumo-shop` through a typed `ExtensionRegistry` with per-`LineKind` dispatch (Backstage-style). Extensions own their own side tables; they never extend `mokumo-shop` base tables. Per-profile activation lives in the meta DB. Not yet built — M4 work.

### Crate roles

- **`crates/kikan/`** — **Engine.** Tenancy, per-profile migration runner, auth (repo + backend + sessions), activity log writer, backup/restore primitives, platform handlers (diagnostics, backup-status, demo reset, discovery/mDNS), SeaORM pool init, middleware (host allow-list, ProfileDb extractor, session layer), event bus types, `PlatformState`, `Engine<G: Graft>`. **Zero vertical-domain knowledge** (invariant I1).
- **`crates/kikan-{events,mail,scheduler,socket,tauri,admin-cli}/`** — Engine satellites. Each is a single-responsibility adapter or SubGraft contributor.
- **`crates/mokumo-shop/`** — **Application.** Shop domain with extension API surface + `MokumoApp: Graft` impl, lifecycle hooks, data-plane router composition, and the BDD/HTTP integration suite under `tests/api_bdd*`. Neutral to decoration technique — decorator-specific concepts (artwork, gang-sheets, stitch-count math) do NOT live here; they live in `crates/extensions/{technique}/` when each milestone introduces its technique. `mokumo-decor` as an anticipatory intermediate crate is **not** introduced now (see amendment in `adr-workspace-split-kikan.md` and `adr-mokumo-extensions.md` §Alternative B rejected).
- **`apps/mokumo-desktop/`** — Tauri binary composing `kikan` + `kikan-tauri` + `mokumo-shop` + `mokumo-spa` for the desktop delivery shell.
- **`apps/mokumo-server/`** — Headless binary composing `kikan` + `kikan-socket` + `mokumo-shop` + `kikan-cli` for the Linux/container delivery shell. **Zero transitive Tauri dependency** (invariant I3, CI-enforced).

### Load-bearing invariants (see `ops/decisions/mokumo/adr-workspace-split-kikan.md` §I1-I5)

- **I1 — Domain purity.** `crates/kikan/src/` contains no shop-vertical identifiers (`customer`, `garment`, `quote`, `invoice`, `print_job`). Shop language belongs in `mokumo-shop`.
- **I2 — Adapter boundary.** No `tauri::` or `#[tauri::command]` under `crates/kikan/**`. CI-enforced.
- **I3 — Headless zero-Tauri.** `cargo tree -p mokumo-server | grep -E '^tauri(-[a-z-]+)?( |$)'` exits non-zero. CI-enforced.
- **I4 — One-way DAG.** `kikan` depends on nothing in the workspace. Adapter crates depend on `kikan`. `mokumo-shop` depends on `kikan`. Binaries compose `kikan` + `mokumo-shop` (+ `kikan-tauri`/`mokumo-spa` for desktop, `kikan-socket`/`kikan-cli` for server).
- **I5 — Feature gates carry Tauri-reachability.** No Cargo feature anywhere pulls Tauri into `kikan`, `kikan-socket`, `mokumo-shop`, or `mokumo-server`.

### Feature organization (vertical slice pattern)

Within each crate, features organize as vertical slices — a module per business concern contains its types, traits, service, repo, and HTTP handler side by side:

```
crates/mokumo-shop/src/
  customer/
    mod.rs          # re-exports
    domain.rs       # Customer type, CustomerId newtype, CustomerRepository trait
    repo.rs         # SqliteCustomerRepository (SeaORM impl)
    service.rs      # CustomerService business logic
    handler.rs      # customer_router() -> Router<CustomerRouterDeps>
  shop/
    ...

crates/kikan/src/
  auth/
    mod.rs          # re-exports
    domain.rs       # User, Role, UserRepository trait
    repo.rs         # SeaOrmUserRepo (composite methods inside transactions)
    backend.rs      # axum-login Backend
    user.rs         # AuthenticatedUser, ProfileUserId session types
```

**Router contribution pattern**: each module that owns HTTP routes exposes a `…RouterDeps` struct holding ONLY singleton dependencies (e.g., `Arc<dyn ActivityWriter>`, rate-limiters) plus a `…_router() -> Router<RouterDeps>` builder. Per-request state (DB handle, session, authenticated user) is extracted via Axum extractors. `kikan::Engine::build_router` assembles the 5-layer middleware stack and nests the domain routes returned by `Graft::data_plane_routes` under `/api/`. This keeps router deps narrow and lets the same sub-router be mounted into the UDS admin surface when appropriate.

**Import rule**: `kikan` never imports from `mokumo-shop` or any extension. Dependencies flow toward `kikan`, never away from it.

## Coding Standards

1. **Rust newtypes for entity IDs** — `struct CustomerId(uuid::Uuid)`, not bare `String`. Never implement `Deref`/`DerefMut` on newtypes — use `.get()` for inner access, `From`/`Into` for conversion. Keep `sea-orm` and `sqlx` derives out of domain types. `DeriveEntityModel` and `FromRow` belong on infrastructure types only (inside whichever crate owns the repo impl). Domain types live with their business logic; wire types for ts-rs live in `crates/kikan-types/`. See `ops/decisions/mokumo/adr-entity-type-placement.md`.
2. **Financial arithmetic in Rust** — money types with fixed-point or integer-cents representation. Never floating-point for prices, totals, or tax.
3. **Hybrid ORM + raw SQL** — SeaORM for entity CRUD operations, `sqlx::query!()` / `sqlx::query_as!()` for complex joins, reporting, and aggregate queries. Never string-concatenated SQL in either approach.
4. **Svelte 5 runes only** — `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`. Never Svelte 4 stores or `export let`.
5. **Axum patterns** — standard Axum server setup, SQLite PRAGMAs (WAL, foreign_keys, busy_timeout), `thiserror` + `IntoResponse` error handling, repository traits with `Send + Sync` bounds. Route builders per module return `Router<SomeRouterDeps>` with singleton deps only; per-request state comes from extractors (see §Architecture).
6. **ts-rs type sharing** — API DTOs live in `crates/kikan-types/` and derive `TS` + `Serialize` for TypeScript generation. SeaORM entity types are infrastructure, not shared. Run `moon run api:gen-types` to regenerate TypeScript bindings.
7. **Error handling** — two layers: `ControlPlaneError` (narrow, handler-level; in `crates/kikan/src/error/`) for admin surface handler signatures, and `AppError` (wider; in `crates/kikan/src/app_error.rs`) for HTTP transport rendering. HTTP adapters convert via `From<ControlPlaneError> for AppError`. UDS adapters render `ControlPlaneError` directly. Both paths produce the same `(ErrorCode, http_status)` tuple — that equality is pinned by `control_plane_error_variants.feature`.
8. **No raw SQL injection** — parameterized queries only.
9. **URL state** — filters, search, pagination in URL query params. Svelte `$state` for ephemeral UI state only.
10. **Repository traits** — `async fn` in traits (Rust 1.75+, no `async-trait` crate **except** where object-safety is required — see `ActivityWriter`). Traits live with the domain they serve; impls live next to them. Bounds: `Send + Sync` only.
11. **SQLite `updated_at` triggers** — every mutable table gets an `AFTER UPDATE` trigger in its migration.
12. **Activity logging is part of the mutation contract, enforced by the adapter.** Entity repository adapters insert activity log entries within the same transaction as the mutation using `kikan::activity::insert_activity_log_raw(tx, entry)`. The service layer does not orchestrate logging — atomicity is guaranteed by the adapter. Every entity vertical (customer, shop, quote, invoice, ...) follows this pattern. `actor_id` is `TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'system'` — no FK to users; transport-native actor tags are the contract (platform callers pass a UUID string, system-initiated actions use `'system'`).
13. **No sealed traits on internal crates** — crate boundaries provide sufficient encapsulation. Sealing blocks test doubles.
14. **SeaORM entity placement** — entities with `DeriveEntityModel` live with their repo impl in whichever crate owns the data (`mokumo-shop` for shop verticals, `kikan` for platform tables like `users`, `activity_log`, `profile_active_extensions`). Never put `DeriveEntityModel` in `kikan-types` or in a domain-pure module.
15. **SeaORM migrations** — every migration returns `Some(true)` from `use_transaction()` (atomic SQLite migrations). Pre-migration backup is non-negotiable. `updated_at` triggers still required per item 11. Migrations compose through kikan's per-profile DAG runner: `kikan::SelfGraft` contributes platform-owned migrations; the primary `Graft` (mokumo's `MokumoApp`) contributes vertical migrations; SubGrafts (mailer, scheduler) contribute their own.
16. **Pre-implementation boundary checklist** — before writing any conditional, path-matching, or range-checking code, answer four questions: (a) What are the boundary values? (b) What happens *at* each boundary? (c) What is the "almost right" input that should be rejected? (d) How does the caller see a rejected input (error code, status, message)? Each answer should have a corresponding test. See `ops/standards/testing/negative-path.md`.
17. **I4 DAG discipline** — `kikan` depends on nothing in the workspace. `mokumo-shop` depends on `kikan` only (and `kikan-types`, `mokumo-core` transitively). Binaries (`mokumo-desktop`, `mokumo-server`) compose multiple crates. If a change would make kikan depend on mokumo-shop, pause and rethink — the surface probably belongs on kikan's side of the boundary or behind a new trait kikan owns.

## Pre-Build Ritual

Before building any vertical: research → shaping → breadboarding → breadboard-reflection → implementation-planning → build → review.

## Deployment

```
session branches ──PR──→ main ──release──→ GitHub Releases (binary)
```

- **main** — integration branch. All PRs merge here.
- Releases are versioned binaries built from main.
- Never push directly to main.

## What NOT to Do

- No separate CSS files — Tailwind only
- No emoji icons — Lucide only
- No Svelte 4 patterns — runes only
- No `any` types in TypeScript — infer from ts-rs generated types
- No floating-point for money — Rust integer-cents or fixed-point
- No pushing to main directly
- No string-concatenated SQL — use SeaORM query builder or `sqlx::query!()` macros
- No hardcoded URLs — env vars or config only
- No bare primitive IDs — Rust newtypes for all entity identifiers
- No eslint — use `oxlint` for linting and `oxfmt` for formatting (OXC toolchain). Prettier only for `.svelte` files. Never install, configure, or run eslint.
- No shop-vertical identifiers in `crates/kikan/**` — customer, garment, quote, invoice, print_job, shop belong in `mokumo-shop` (invariant I1).
- No `tauri::` or `#[tauri::command]` under `crates/kikan/**` — Tauri integration lives in `kikan-tauri` only (invariant I2).
- No dependency on `mokumo-shop`, `mokumo-desktop`, `mokumo-server`, or any adapter crate from inside `crates/kikan/` — DAG flows toward kikan, never away (invariant I4).
- No `DeriveEntityModel` on types in domain or wire-type modules — entities are infrastructure types; they live with their repo impl.
- No non-transactional SeaORM migrations — every migration must use `use_transaction() -> Some(true)`.
- No caret/tilde version ranges on SeaORM RC — use exact pin `"=2.0.0-rc.38"` in Cargo.toml.
- No `mokumo-decor` references — that intermediate crate is deferred per `adr-mokumo-extensions.md`; shared decoration primitives live in `mokumo-shop` until a concrete second-consumer forces extraction.
- No "auto-repair litmus test" as a design gate — that framing was retired by the extensions ADR. Mokumo IS the decoration shop app; decoration-specific concepts are welcome in `mokumo-shop` if they're not extension-specific, and in `crates/extensions/{technique}/` if they are.
