# Print the date-pinned nightly channel from `rust-nightly-coverage-toolchain.toml`.
#
# Single source of truth for two consumers:
#   - `crates/mokumo-shop/moon.yml` task `coverage-branches` (sets
#     `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` for one invocation of `cargo llvm-cov --branch`).
#   - `.github/workflows/quality.yml` job `coverage-handlers` (passes the
#     channel to `setup-rust@v1` / `rustup toolchain install`).
#
# Centralising the parse in one script means a pin bump is a single-file edit
# (the `.toml`) — no scattered `nightly-YYYY-MM-DD` strings to keep in sync.
#
# Removable in one step when branch coverage stabilizes on rustc stable:
# delete this script and `rust-nightly-coverage-toolchain.toml` together with
# the `coverage-branches` moon task and the `coverage-handlers` CI job.
