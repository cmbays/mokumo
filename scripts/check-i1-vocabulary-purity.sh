# I1/strict — Vocabulary purity for kikan source.
#
# kikan is the platform crate; the vertical (Mokumo) owns its profile
# vocabulary (`demo`, `production`, ...). kikan must reach those names
# only through the `Graft` trait + `ProfileDirName` opaque key (per
# adr-kikan-engine-vocabulary).
#
# This script greps `crates/kikan/src/` for the literal strings `demo`,
# `production`, `Demo`, `Production` (whole-word) outside of:
#   - inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules (truncated per-file at first match)
#   - `//`-prefixed comment lines (rustdoc included)
#   - a small allow-list of files with known pre-existing structural
#     leaks scheduled for cleanup in PR B (slug RESERVED_SLUGS, legacy
#     folder name in boot_state, etc.) — see the ALLOWLIST below.
#
# Each allow-list entry SHOULD shrink and eventually disappear. New
# files MUST NOT be added to the allow-list without updating
# `proposed-adr-collapse-mokumo-core-and-vocabulary-neutral-kikan.md`
# (or its promoted form).
