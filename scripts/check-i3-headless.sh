# I3a — Headless server has zero Tauri / webview deps.
#
# mokumo-server must compile and link without dragging in Tauri, webkit2gtk,
# or wry — they would block container/musl deployment. See:
#   - adr-workspace-split-kikan (I3)
#   - adr-kikan-binary-topology
#
# The check runs cargo tree under two feature configurations:
#   - default features: production path; what the release binary links
#   - no-default features: guards against a future default feature masking
#     a Tauri-bearing dep. If a feature becomes non-default but still pulls
#     Tauri, the default-only audit would miss it as the feature surface
#     grows (#554).
#
# I3b (musl cross-compile) is a separate CI job; see kikan-musl-build.
