# Guard: every newly-introduced API route in the diff requires hurl coverage
# for each HTTP method, OR a matching entry in the moon.yml exclusion ledger.
#
# How it works:
#   - Detects added `.route("...", <method>(...))` calls under
#     `crates/**/src/**/*.rs`. Multi-line `.route(\n  "<path>",\n  ...,\n)`
#     blocks are recognised by joining consecutive `+`-prefixed diff lines
#     per file before applying the route-extraction regex.
#   - Resolves relative paths in sub-routers: a `.route("/{id}/restore", ...)`
#     added inside a function whose name appears as the second arg of a
#     `.nest("/api/<prefix>", <fn>())` call in `routes.rs` is treated as
#     `/api/<prefix>/{id}/restore`.
#   - Per-method coverage: each HTTP method on a route (`get(h).post(h)`
#     yields two endpoints) is checked independently. Coverage matches when
#     a hurl file has a request line `<METHOD> http(s)?://<host><path>`
#     with `{id}`-style segments treated as `[^/]+`.
#
# Background: mokumo CLAUDE.md mandates per-endpoint hurl coverage:
#   "New API endpoints require a `.hurl` file — add
#   `tests/api/<domain>/<endpoint>.hurl` in the same PR."
#
# Diff base: `origin/main`. Local hooks tolerate a stale base ref because
# CI is the source of truth (CI sets STRICT_BASE_REF=1 to fail loudly on
# missing ref).
#
# Known residual gaps (out of scope for this guard):
#   - Mounting a pre-existing router under a new `.nest("/api/X", ...)`
#     prefix without inline `.route(...)` changes is not flagged.
#   - Routes added via `MethodRouter::new().on(MethodFilter::*, ...)` form
#     (axum supports it; mokumo does not currently use it) are not detected.
#   - Cosmetic re-emissions of an unchanged `.route(...)` line are treated
#     as new endpoints; harmless when the existing hurl is unchanged.
#   - Adding a method to a multi-line `.route(\n  "<path>",\n  <chain>,\n)`
#     block where the path line is unchanged: the `--unified=0` diff buffer
#     captures only the chain delta, so the route's path can't be resolved
#     and the new method is missed. Single-line chain edits (where path +
#     chain share a line) and whole-route additions ARE caught. Closing
#     this case requires post-image vs pre-image parsing — tracked
#     separately.
