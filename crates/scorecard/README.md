# scorecard

The scorecard crate owns the typed wire format for the **sticky PR scorecard**
comment that mokumo posts on every pull request. It is the source of truth
for both producer and renderer: a Rust binary writes `scorecard.json` from
gate outputs, the committed JSON Schema in `.config/scorecard/schema.json`
is the validator's contract, and a Node renderer in
`.github/workflows/scorecard-comment.yml` reads the artifact and posts/updates
the sticky comment.

The crate is governed by
[`decisions/mokumo/adr-scorecard-crate-shape.md`](../../decisions/mokumo/adr-scorecard-crate-shape.md)
(in `~/Github/ops`). The ADR's four-forcing-functions framework chose a
**single crate** over a multi-crate split; the lib stays mokumo-deps-zero
(`serde + schemars + serde_json` only) and binary tooling lives behind
the optional `cli` feature so downstream consumers don't transitively pull
`toml`, `walkdir`, `clap`, or `jsonschema`. Verify with
`cargo tree -p scorecard --no-default-features`.

## Three layers of `failure_detail_md` enforcement

A row with `status: Red` MUST carry an inline `failure_detail_md` string.
This is enforced at three layers (ADR §"Three layers"):

| Layer | Mechanism | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Typestate | `Row` and each variant are `#[non_exhaustive]`, so external callers cannot struct-literal a row and cannot match without a wildcard arm. They must construct via methods on `Row`; the methods mint `Status` internally so callers cannot supply a wrong status; `Row::coverage_delta_red` takes `failure_detail_md: String` (not `Option<String>`) | `src/lib.rs` |
| 2 — JSON Schema | `if status == "Red" then required: ["failure_detail_md"], properties.failure_detail_md.type: "string"` injected by post-processing — closes both the missing-field and the explicit-null paths. Helper lives in `src/schema_postprocess.rs`, consumed by both the binary and the drift-check integration test | `src/schema_postprocess.rs` |
| 3 — Renderer defensive | Renderer logs warning + renders `(detail missing — see workflow logs)` if a Red row arrives without detail | `.github/workflows/scorecard-comment.yml` |

Layer 1 is verified by the `tests/trybuild/` UI tests. Layer 2 is verified
by the `schema_drift` integration test, which asserts the binary output
matches the committed schema byte-for-byte (any change to the if/then
helper that breaks injection will fail this test before merge).

## Trybuild ↔ rust-toolchain.toml coupling

`tests/trybuild/*.stderr` files are **rustc stderr snapshots** — trybuild
compares the actual compiler output to them byte-for-byte. That makes them
sensitive to rustc version: stable's six-week cadence drifts the wording
(note positions, help-line whitespace, error-code suggestions), which is
exactly the noise we don't want polluting unrelated PRs.

`rust-toolchain.toml` at the workspace root pins the toolchain. **Toolchain
bumps are a synchronized change** with the .stderr snapshots:

```bash
# 1. Bump rust-toolchain.toml
# 2. Regenerate the snapshots:
TRYBUILD=overwrite cargo test -p scorecard --test trybuild
# 3. Verify the tests still fail for the right reason:
cargo test -p scorecard --test trybuild
# 4. Inspect the diffs in tests/trybuild/*.stderr and confirm each test
#    still asserts the same error code (E0061 for arity, E0308 for type
#    mismatch, E0639 for non_exhaustive).
```

If the .stderr drift is more than whitespace, audit it before accepting —
the tests are supposed to catch typestate violations, not "compiler
reformatted its output".

## Regenerating the committed schema

```bash
cargo run -p scorecard --bin emit-schema -- --out .config/scorecard/schema.json
```

`emit-schema` uses only the lib's deps (no `--features cli` needed) so a
drift-check workflow can regenerate the schema cheaply. The integration
test `tests/schema_drift.rs` enforces byte-identity between the binary's
output and the committed file on every `cargo test` run.
