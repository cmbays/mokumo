//! Threshold resolution — producer-side mapping from raw measurements to
//! [`Status`](crate::Status) (`Green` / `Yellow` / `Red`).
//!
//! The module owns the operator-tunable surface that turns a raw
//! measurement (e.g. coverage delta in percentage points) into the
//! status icon the renderer paints on the sticky comment. Resolution
//! lives in the producer (Rust) so the renderer stays a dumb formatter
//! — see `decisions/mokumo/adr-scorecard-crate-shape.md` §Threshold
//! resolution lives in the producer for the architectural rationale.
//!
//! # Dependencies
//!
//! `serde + schemars + serde_json` only. The TOML parser sits behind
//! the `cli` feature so a downstream `cargo add scorecard` does not
//! pull `toml` transitively, and `cargo check -p scorecard
//! --no-default-features` keeps compiling [`ThresholdConfig`] +
//! [`schemars::schema_for!`] without a TOML dependency anywhere in the
//! transitive tree.
//!
//! # In-crate Layer-1 discipline
//!
//! `Row` and each variant are `#[non_exhaustive]`, blocking external
//! crates from struct-literal construction or non-wildcard pattern
//! matches. Inside `scorecard` both remain reachable: the rule that
//! rows are constructed via the `Row::coverage_delta_{green,yellow,red}`
//! constructors only is convention, enforced by code review. New row
//! variants gain a sibling free function in this module (one
//! `resolve_*` per `Row` variant); resolver dispatch is by call site,
//! not by trait. See the ADR for the dispatch convention rationale.
//!
//! # Doc-drift markers
//!
//! [`FALLBACK_MARKER`], [`STARTER_PREAMBLE`], and [`PATH_HINT_COMMENT`]
//! are the three byte-stable strings the renderer emits when the
//! producer ran without an operator config. They are pinned by vitest
//! snapshots so any drift between the renderer's emitted bytes and
//! these constants surfaces as a snapshot diff on PR review.
