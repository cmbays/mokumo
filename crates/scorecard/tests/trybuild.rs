//! Trybuild harness for Layer 1 typestate enforcement of the scorecard schema.
//!
//! These UI tests guard the invariant that a `Row` with `status: Red` cannot
//! be constructed without a `failure_detail_md: String` — at compile time,
//! not runtime. See `decisions/mokumo/adr-scorecard-crate-shape.md` (Layer
//! 1) and the .feature scenario "The Rust typestate API forbids constructing
//!    a Red row without failure_detail_md at compile time".
//!
//! Three angles are exercised:
//!
//! - **Arity** — calling `coverage_delta_red` with the failure_detail_md
//!   argument missing is rejected (E0061).
//! - **Type** — calling `coverage_delta_red` with `None` instead of a
//!   `String` is rejected (E0308); guards against signature drift to
//!   `Option<String>`.
//! - **Struct literal** — constructing `Row::CoverageDelta { ... }` directly
//!   from outside the crate is rejected because the variant is
//!   `#[non_exhaustive]` (E0639); guards against bypassing the constructor
//!   surface.
//!
//! Trybuild snapshots rustc's stderr by name, which drifts across toolchain
//! releases. The toolchain pin in `rust-toolchain.toml` (workspace root)
//! is the stability baseline — see this crate's README for the bump
//! runbook. Toolchain bumps are a synchronized change with the .stderr
//! files in `tests/trybuild/*.stderr`.
