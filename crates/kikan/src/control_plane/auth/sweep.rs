//! Background sweep that bounds [`crate::PlatformState::reset_pins`] memory
//! at `~PIN_EXPIRY × issuance_rate`.
//!
//! Lazy eviction inside [`super::recover_complete`] handles the redeem
//! path — `DashMap::remove` is the atomic consume on every submission,
//! correct or not. This sweep handles the abandoned path: a user who
//! requests a PIN but never returns to redeem it. Without the sweep,
//! such records would accumulate until process restart.
//!
//! The task is `tokio::spawn`ed once at engine boot. Cancellation
//! flows through [`crate::PlatformState::shutdown`] so the task ends
//! cleanly when the engine stops.
