//! Recovery-session pure-fn core.
//!
//! Two functions: [`recover_request`] mints a session for a known email
//! (or a synthesized session-id-only response for an unknown one, to
//! preserve enumeration resistance), and [`recover_complete`] consumes a
//! session by validating a 6-digit PIN and updating the user's password.
//!
//! Storage is [`crate::PlatformState::reset_pins`], an in-memory
//! `DashMap<RecoverySessionId, PendingReset>`. Eviction is two-tiered:
//! atomic `remove` on every redeem attempt (lazy) plus a 60s background
//! sweep (see [`super::sweep`]) that bounds memory at
//! `~PIN_EXPIRY × issuance_rate`.
//!
//! ## Anti-enumeration
//!
//! [`recover_request`] always returns a [`RecoverySessionId`] and a
//! [`RecoveryArtifactLocation`] regardless of whether `email` matches a
//! known user. On unknown emails the engine synthesises a session id
//! with no DashMap entry; any later [`recover_complete`] against that
//! token fails uniformly with [`ControlPlaneError::Validation`] and the
//! same wire shape as a wrong PIN. Callers cannot distinguish
//! "unknown email" from "wrong PIN" from "expired session".
//!
//! Both the artifact write and the Argon2id PIN hash run on every
//! request — known and unknown — so the response time profile is
//! identical regardless of whether the email matches a user. The
//! Argon2id work for unknown emails is discarded; that wasted CPU is
//! the cost of flattening the timing oracle.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! `DashMap::remove(&session_id)` is the atomic compare-and-swap. Two
//! concurrent `recover_complete` calls with the same session id race —
//! exactly one wins the `remove`; the other gets `None` and the uniform
//! 400. The winning thread either consumes the entry (success or 3rd
//! failed attempt) or re-inserts with `attempts += 1`. The increment
//! cannot race with another concurrent submission because the entry is
//! held in local-fn scope between the `remove` and the conditional
//! `insert`, which closes a TOCTOU window the previous email-keyed
//! design had open.
