//! Pure-function control-plane operations for profile switching.
//!
//! ## Transport-neutral boundary
//!
//! `switch_profile` encapsulates the three persistence operations that are
//! independent of HTTP / session machinery:
//!
//! 1. **User lookup** — verify the target email resolves to an active user in
//!    the target profile DB, capturing the `AuthenticatedUser` the adapter
//!    will hand to `auth_session.login`.
//! 2. **Disk persist** — write `active_profile` atomically (tmp-then-rename)
//!    so a crash between operations leaves the on-disk selection consistent.
//! 3. **Memory flip** — update `PlatformState::active_profile`.
//!
//! ## Session glue stays in the adapter
//!
//! Rate limiting, CSRF/Origin validation, session logout, session login, and
//! the SESSION_KEY_PRODUCTION_EMAIL carry-over are inherently transport-coupled
//! and live in `services/api/src/profile_switch.rs`. That adapter calls this
//! fn after resolving the target email from the active session.
//!
//! ## Rollback contract
//!
//! `SwitchOutcome::previous_profile` gives the adapter a cheap rollback handle:
//! if the subsequent `auth_session.logout()` or `auth_session.login()` fails, the
//! adapter should restore `state.platform.active_profile` to `previous_profile`
//! and make a best-effort disk rollback. The adapter owns this recovery path
//! because session errors are transport-native.
