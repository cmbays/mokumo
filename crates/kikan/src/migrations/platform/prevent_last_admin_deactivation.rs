//! M00 platform migration: refuse to deactivate the last active install Admin.
//!
//! Install-level Admin count must stay ≥ 1. Without this trigger, a
//! mis-click in the Users screen ("Deactivate") on the sole Admin would
//! lock every operator out of the admin surface; the only recovery would
//! be a DB edit or a full reinstall.
//!
//! Enforced at the DB layer (not just the API) to make the invariant
//! transport-independent — CLI tools and direct SQL sessions cannot
//! bypass the guard. The UI still surfaces the same invariant with a
//! toast to prevent the user from ever seeing the raw trigger error.
//!
//! See `ops/decisions/mokumo/adr-kikan-admin-ui.md` §ADR-5 for the role
//! model this guard enforces.
