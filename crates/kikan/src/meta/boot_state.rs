//! Boot-state detection — figures out what kind of data directory we're
//! looking at so the engine can decide whether to do a fresh install,
//! a normal boot, a legacy upgrade, or refuse with a defensive error.

//! Each variant carries the data its corresponding handler needs (e.g.
//! `LegacyCompleted` carries the display name derived from the legacy
//! vertical DB so the upgrade handler doesn't have to re-open it).
