//! SPA (single-page-application) serving seam.
//!
//! The data-plane fallback is how the Engine serves a browser SPA — in
//! Mokumo's case, the SvelteKit build from `apps/web/build`. Kikan owns
//! the *composition point* (API routes register first, SPA serves
//! everything else); the actual asset bytes live in a sister crate that
//! picks the embedding strategy.
//!
//! `kikan` stays rust-embed-free — pulling a build-artifact-dependent
//! crate into every kikan build would violate invariant I5. The
//! sister-crate pattern (`kikan-spa-sveltekit`, any future `kikan-spa-*`)
//! lets consumers opt in at the edge.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! A [`Graft`](crate::Graft) may return `Some(Box<dyn SpaSource>)` from
//! [`Graft::spa_source`](crate::Graft::spa_source). [`Engine::new_with`]
//! captures it once at construction and mounts the returned router as
//! the data-plane fallback inside
//! [`Engine::build_router`](crate::Engine::build_router) —
//! `API routes register first, fallback last`, which is idiomatic Axum.
//!
//! Grafts that don't serve an SPA (headless deployments, CLI-only tools,
//! tests) return `None`; the engine skips fallback registration and
//! non-API paths produce Axum's default 404.
