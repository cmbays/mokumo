//! Platform-state slice shared across kikan-owned handlers.
//!
//! `PlatformState` groups the fields that platform handlers — diagnostics,
//! demo reset, backup status, diagnostics bundle — need to function. Kept
//! separate from the vertical's `AppState` so kikan handlers stay free of
//! any I4-violating dependency on `mokumo-shop`.
//!
//! ## Wiring
//!
//! The vertical's `AppState` (in `mokumo_shop::state`) composes a
//! `PlatformState` and exposes it via `Graft::platform_state` so Axum
//! handlers can extract it directly:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use axum::extract::State;
//! use kikan::PlatformState;
//!
//! async fn some_handler(State(platform): State<PlatformState>) { ... }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Capability vs vocabulary
//!
//! The `pools`, `profile_dir_names`, `requires_setup_by_dir`, and
//! `db_filename` fields are *capability data*: boot-time snapshots sourced
//! from the `Graft` (a verticals `ProfileKind` enum, its `db_filename()`,
//! and its per-kind vocabulary hooks) and reduced to opaque `ProfileDirName`
//! keys. Kikan never names a specific profile — it iterates the keys the
//! graft handed it and looks up pools by string.
