//! Kikan — self-hosted application platform Engine.
//!
//! Owns tenancy, per-profile migrations, auth, activity log,
//! backup/restore, control-plane handlers, SeaORM pool init,
//! data-plane middleware, and the [`Engine`] + [`Graft`] + [`SubGraft`]
//! composition seam. Depends on nothing else in the workspace
//! (invariant I4); the Application (`mokumo-shop`) and SubGrafts
//! (`kikan-events`, `kikan-mail`, `kikan-scheduler`) compose in
//! through [`Graft`] / [`SubGraft`] at compile time.
//!
//! # Data plane
//!
//! [`DataPlaneConfig`] + [`DeploymentMode`] (see [`data_plane`]) drive the
//! HTTP middleware stack. Three postures — `Lan`, `Internet`, `ReverseProxy` —
//! pick cookie flags, CSRF gating, per-IP rate limiting, and `X-Forwarded-*`
//! trust. The per-mode matrix and layer order are documented at the
//! [`data_plane`] module level.
//!
//! # Startup and concurrent safety
//!
//! kikan provides **in-process** concurrent-safety for every SeaORM pool
//! it manages:
//!
//! - `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` — readers don't block writers; writers
//!   serialize through a single write lock. Applied by [`db::pragmas`]
//!   on every connection.
//! - `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000` — a 5-second retry window before
//!   `SQLITE_BUSY` surfaces to the caller, enough for short write
//!   contention within a single Engine to self-resolve.
//! - Migrations run in `SqliteTransactionMode::Immediate` (see
//!   [`migrations::runner`]) — each migration acquires the write lock
//!   on `BEGIN` rather than upgrading lazily, so concurrent writes from
//!   application tasks cannot race a boot-time migration.
//!
//! **Cross-process** single-Engine-per-data-directory is the caller's
//! precondition — kikan does not enforce it. Two Engines booted against
//! the same data directory would still collide on backup-API calls,
//! sidecar swaps, and migration runs even with WAL on, because those
//! operations manipulate the database file outside SQLite's locking
//! protocol. The Application is responsible for single-instance
//! enforcement; see `ops/decisions/mokumo/adr-process-lock-flock.md`
//! for the adapter-level mechanism.
//!
//! Place platform-shaped code here. Shop-vertical identifiers belong
//! in `mokumo-shop` (invariant I1, enforced by
//! `scripts/check-i1-domain-purity.sh`); shell adapters in
//! `kikan-tauri` / `kikan-socket` / `kikan-cli`. See
//! `ops/decisions/mokumo/adr-kikan-engine-vocabulary.md`.
